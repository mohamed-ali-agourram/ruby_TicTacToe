# Tic-Tac-Toe Ruby App
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Ruby. It was created as part of my learning journey with TheOdinProject to explore object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Ruby. This game allows two players to take turns and compete against each other in the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.
